#The Gospel
Jesus Christ is the Son of God, born of a virgin. He lived a sinless life while on earth, went around preaching
to repent and believe in the good news and turn to God by following Him, and making many miracles to back up His claim.
Jesus was crucified for our transgressions, as God is perfect and so Holy and Just that we have all fallen short 
of being able to get into Heaven and we needed a Savior. Jesus rose again on the third day in accordance with the 
Scriptures, and was made the Lord where He now reigns.

For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, than whomever believes in Him shall not perish,
but will have everlasting life (John 3:16).

God's kingdom is not of this dark world, sin entered the world through the first man Adam,
and we have all fallen short but Him. Even not doing the good we know we ought is Sin.  
The gate is large and the way broad that leads to destruction and many go on it, 
and small is the gate and narrow the way that leads to life and few find it. Therefore make
every attempt to enter the narrow gate. Jesus Christ is the truth, the life and the way,
and no one comes to the Father but through Him.

If you truly believe with all your heart in Jesus Christ as He says He is in the Bible then call out:

> Lord Jesus Christ who came in the flesh, Thank You that I believe you died in my place and where resurrected and are the Lord,
> save me, forgive me as I also forgive everyone who has done me wrong, may Your will be done,
> I give You all i am, all i have, all my generations future and past and all of existence that
> Your will be done and not mine, provide for our needs, lead us not into temptation, deliver us
> from the evil one, heal us and help us enter Your rest, send workers to the harvest and 
> baptize me and fill me with the Holy Spirit, Thank You Jesus for what You did, to God be the 
> Power, the Kingdom and the Glory forever and ever in Thy name Jesus, amen!

Go get baptized in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, start praying, reading the Bible and
go with other Bible believing Christians and welcome to God's family! God will discipline you but He will console you,
remember the two greatest commandments, love God with all your heart, soul, mind and strength and love your neighbor
as you love yourself, the love of God is to obey His commands and His commands which are not burdensome and
are cleaving to the name of Jesus and loving others. Do it from a pure heart, a good conscience and a sincere faith
in Jesus name, and remember that you can trust in Jesus that no one can take His sheep from His hand! 
He's got you! Work out your salvation with fear and trembling, and the utmost of holiness, as without holiness no one
will see the Lord!
